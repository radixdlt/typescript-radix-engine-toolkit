# About

This library brings the same support offered to Rust for transaction construction, validation, and decompilation, manifest parsing, **S**crypto **B**inary **O**bject **R**epresentation (SBOR) encoding and decoding, address derivations, and more to TypeScript and JavaScript through a [Rust backend](https://www.github.com/radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit) that powers it all. The following is a list of the features offered by this library:

- Offline transaction construction and transaction manifest construction.
- Cryptographic primitives for signing and notarizing transactions.
- Static (offline) transaction validation.
- The ability to convert manifests into their Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation and back to their string representation.
- Full support for all flavors of SBOR allowing clients to perform SBOR encoding and decoding.
- The ability to perform deterministic mapping of public keys to virtual account addresses, virtual component addresses, and Olympia account addresses. In addition to the ability to perform the deterministic mapping from Olympia account addresses to Babylon account addresses
- All of the needed features to build a complete programmatic wallet as evident by the iOS and Android wallet which utilize Radix Engine Toolkit wrappers in their respective languages.

# Architecture

The TypeScript Radix Engine Toolkit library is powered by the [Core Radix Engine Toolkit](https://github.com/radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit/): a library written entirely in Rust that can be compiled to WebAssembly modules, native libraries, and other targets supported by the Rust compiler. The Core Radix Engine Toolkit contains all of the core functionality, while this TypeScript library is simply a wrapper around the core Radix Engine Toolkit that is able to make invocations to it and interprets its responses.

This TypeScript wrapper around the Radix Engine Toolkit uses the WebAssembly as the method of interoperability between the Rust code and TypeScript. More specifically, this wrapper acts as a WebAssembly host that invokes the core Radix Engine Toolkit and interprets its responses. In addition to that, this wrapper builds higher level abstractions above the concept of WebAssembly function invocation and build an idiomatic TypeScript API which translates down to Radix Engine Toolkit WebAssembly function invocations without the need to deal in raw requests and responses.

Since the core functionality of this library is included in the compiled WebAssembly module, this library needs to be used in an environment that can act as a WebAssembly host which most browsers Node.JS support.

There are three main classes that act as the entrypoint into the Radix Engine Toolkit. The following table talks about these classes.

| Class Name              | Functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RawRadixEngineToolkit` | The main wrapper and WASM host around the Radix Engine Toolkit, this class abstracts the complexity of performing WASM invocation down to a single simple `invoke` function that can be called with a function pointer, some arguments for the function, and the type of the return. This class is not very user friendly to use since it deals in the raw request and response objects required by the core Radix Engine Toolkit. Thus, you will almost never find yourself using this class except in very niche cases.                                                                    |
| `RadixEngineToolkit`    | The main developer facing class that is used to invoke the core Radix Engine Toolkit. The interface of the functions defined on this class does not use the request and response objects. Instead, it provides a more idiomatic TypeScript/JavaScript interface that is familiar to developers and that is easy to use. Under the hood, the functions exposed in this class translate down to core Radix Engine Toolkit requests and are then forwarded to the appropriate functions on the `RawRadixEngineToolkit` class. This is the class that you will most likely use very often.       |
| `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` | A thin wrapper around the `RadixEngineToolkit` class that exposes an API that will have very little breaking changes from now until mainnet. The `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` class is not meant to provide all of the functionality of the toolkit; quite the opposite: it's meant to provide little functionality with well defined simpler interfaces that won't change that integrators can use. However, it is very likely that some clients might quickly "outgrow" this class and it's simple interfaces. Clients who encounter that are recommended to use the `RadixEngineToolkit` class |

The following is a summary of the above table:

- Do not use the `RawRadixEngineToolkit` class as this is a class meant for the internal usage of the Radix Engine Toolkit and has no guarantees whatsoever on backward compatibility.
- If you are a developer using this library, you want to use the `RadixEngineToolkit` class.
- If you are an integrator who cares about having an interface with little changes and wish higher backward compatibility guarantees, then use `LTSRadixEngineToolkit`.

# Installation

# High Level Functionality

This library comes with a number of high-level functionalities that can be useful to a number of clients. Among those functionalities is the ability to build manifests and contract transactions.

## Building Manifests

The Radix Engine Toolkit comes with a manifest builder which is heavily inspired by the builder present in the Scrypto repository and commonly seen in unit test. This manifest builder has an ID allocator which allows users of the builder to not specify the ids for various buckets and proofs created in the manifest. Additionally, the manifest builder is able to handle blobs in a more developer friendly way for instructions such as `PublishPackage`.

```ts
import { ManifestBuilder } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let manifest = new ManifestBuilder()
  .callMethod(
    "account_sim1q3cztnp4h232hsfmu0j63f7f7mz5wxhd0n0hqax6smjqznhzrp",
    "withdraw",
    [
      new ManifestAstValue.Address(
        "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd"
      ),
      new ManifestAstValue.Decimal(10),
    ]
  )
  .takeFromWorktop(
    "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd",
    (builder, bucket) =>
      builder.callMethod(
        "account_sim1qs5mg6tcehg95mugc9d3lpl90clnl787zmhc92cf04wqvqvztr",
        "deposit",
        [bucket]
      )
  )
  .build();

console.log(manifest.toString());
```

## Constructing Transactions

The Radix Engine toolkit comes with a transaction builder through the `TransactionBuilder` class that is very similar to that seen in the Scrypto repository. The transaction builder allows for the construction of transactions all the way from the header to the notarized transactions. The main purpose of the builder is to abstract the complexities of transaction construction away from the developer since using the transaction builder does not require the user to have knowledge of transaction compilation, hashing, or anything else of that sort. It, alongside the `ManifestBuilder`, makes the transaction construction process much simpler.

The following example shows the transaction builder can be used to construct a transaction.

```ts
import {
  ManifestAstValue,
  ManifestBuilder,
  NetworkId,
  NotarizedTransaction,
  PrivateKey,
  TransactionBuilder,
  TransactionHeader,
  TransactionManifest,
  ValidationConfig,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

const secureRandom = (): number => {
  /* The implementation of a secure random number generator */
  return 1;
};

// For this transaction, we wish to have multiple signers (and of course, a single notary). So, we
// define their cryptographic private keys.
let notaryPrivateKey = new PrivateKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "40c1b9deccc56c0da69821dd652782887b5d31fe6bf6ead519a23f9e9472b49b"
);

let signer1PrivateKey = new PrivateKey.EddsaEd25519(
  "69366e446ad19a7540b4272c614bbc2b242656815eb03b1d29a53c950201ae76"
);
let signer2PrivateKey = new PrivateKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "5068952ca5aa655fe9257bf2d89f3b86f4dda6be6f5b76e4ed104c38fd21e8d7"
);

// We first begin by creating the transaction header that will be used for the transaction.
let transactionHeader = new TransactionHeader(
  1 /* The transaction version. Currently always 1 */,
  NetworkId.Simulator /* The network that this transaction is destined to */,
  3910 /* The start epoch (inclusive) of when this transaction becomes valid */,
  3920 /* The end epoch (exclusive) of when this transaction is no longer valid */,
  secureRandom() /* A random nonce */,
  notaryPrivateKey.publicKey() /* The public key of the notary */,
  true /* Whether the notary signature is also considered as an intent signature */,
  100_000_000 /* A limit on the amount of cost units that the transaction can consume */,
  0 /* The percentage of fees that goes to validators */
);

// We then build the transaction manifest
let transactionManifest: TransactionManifest = new ManifestBuilder()
  .callMethod(
    "account_sim1q3cztnp4h232hsfmu0j63f7f7mz5wxhd0n0hqax6smjqznhzrp",
    "withdraw",
    [
      new ManifestAstValue.Address(
        "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd"
      ),
      new ManifestAstValue.Decimal(10),
    ]
  )
  .takeFromWorktop(
    "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd",
    (builder, bucket) =>
      builder.callMethod(
        "account_sim1qs5mg6tcehg95mugc9d3lpl90clnl787zmhc92cf04wqvqvztr",
        "deposit",
        [bucket]
      )
  )
  .build();

// We may now build the complete transaction through the transaction builder.
let transaction: NotarizedTransaction = await TransactionBuilder.new().then(
  (builder) =>
    builder
      .header(transactionHeader)
      .manifest(transactionManifest)
      .sign(signer1PrivateKey)
      .sign(signer2PrivateKey)
      .notarize(notaryPrivateKey)
);
let transactionId: Uint8Array = await transaction.transactionId();
console.log(Convert.Uint8Array.toHexString(transactionId));

// Check that the transaction that we've just built is statically valid.
let transactionValidity = await transaction.staticallyValidate(
  ValidationConfig.default(NetworkId.Simulator)
);
console.log(transactionValidity);
```

The constructed transaction can then be compiled and submitted to the Network Gateway to be processed by the network.

As can be seen in the calls to `sign` and `notarize` these methods take in a private key as an argument. However, some clients might wish not to expose their private keys to the transaction builder for various security concerns, or since an HSM is being used. In this case, the `sign` and `notarize` functions can be called with signature functions as an arguments. These functions would take in the hash to sign and would need to return back a `Signature.Signature` or a `SignatureWithPublicKey.SignatureWithPublicKey`. The following is an example of how that can be achieved.

```ts
import {
  ManifestAstValue,
  ManifestBuilder,
  NetworkId,
  NotarizedTransaction,
  Signature,
  SignatureWithPublicKey,
  TransactionBuilder,
  TransactionHeader,
  TransactionManifest,
  ValidationConfig,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

const secureRandom = (): number => {
  /* The implementation of a secure random number generator */
  return 1;
};

// @ts-ignore
const signIntent = (hashToSign: Uint8Array): Signature.Signature => {
  /* This method takes in the hash to sign, signs it, and then returns it as a Signature.Signature */
};

// @ts-ignore
const notarizeIntent = (
  hashToSign: Uint8Array
): SignatureWithPublicKey.SignatureWithPublicKey => {
  /* This method takes in the hash to sign, signs it, and then returns it as a SignatureWithPublicKey.SignatureWithPublicKey */
};

// We first begin by creating the transaction header that will be used for the transaction.
let transactionHeader = new TransactionHeader(
  1 /* The transaction version. Currently always 1 */,
  NetworkId.Simulator /* The network that this transaction is destined to */,
  3910 /* The start epoch (inclusive) of when this transaction becomes valid */,
  3920 /* The end epoch (exclusive) of when this transaction is no longer valid */,
  secureRandom() /* A random nonce */,
  notaryPublicKey /* The public key of the notary */,
  true /* Whether the notary signature is also considered as an intent signature */,
  100_000_000 /* A limit on the amount of cost units that the transaction can consume */,
  0 /* The percentage of fees that goes to validators */
);

// We then build the transaction manifest
let transactionManifest: TransactionManifest = new ManifestBuilder()
  .callMethod(
    "account_sim1q3cztnp4h232hsfmu0j63f7f7mz5wxhd0n0hqax6smjqznhzrp",
    "withdraw",
    [
      new ManifestAstValue.Address(
        "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd"
      ),
      new ManifestAstValue.Decimal(10),
    ]
  )
  .takeFromWorktop(
    "resource_sim1qf7mtmy9a6eczv9km4j4ul38cfvap0zy6juuj8m8xnxqlla6pd",
    (builder, bucket) =>
      builder.callMethod(
        "account_sim1qs5mg6tcehg95mugc9d3lpl90clnl787zmhc92cf04wqvqvztr",
        "deposit",
        [bucket]
      )
  )
  .build();

// We may now build the complete transaction through the transaction builder.
let transaction: NotarizedTransaction = await TransactionBuilder.new().then(
  (builder) =>
    builder
      .header(transactionHeader)
      .manifest(transactionManifest)
      .sign(signIntent)
      .notarize(notarizeIntent)
);
let transactionId: Uint8Array = await transaction.transactionId();
console.log(Convert.Uint8Array.toHexString(transactionId));

// Check that the transaction that we've just built is statically valid.
let transactionValidity = await transaction.staticallyValidate(
  ValidationConfig.default(NetworkId.Simulator)
);
console.log(transactionValidity);
```

# Functionality

This section discusses the raw functionality offered by the TypeScript Radix Engine Toolkit and provides examples for how they can be achieved in code.

## Convert Manifest

The most common format for transaction manifests is the string format seen in Radix Transaction Manifest `.rtm` files and in other places as well. However, there does exist another format for representing manifests: the `Parsed` format.

While the `String` format of manifests focuses heavily on being easily human-readable with some focus on ease of parsing and lexing, the `Parsed` format focuses more heavily on being very machine-readable where it should be relatively easy for machines to understand, process, and work with the `Parsed` format. The `Parsed` format is a JSON format for the instructions of transaction manifests that represents instructions as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Both of the manifest format compile down to identical byte code; thus, using either of the formats purely comes down to a choice by the client to either favour human-readability or machine-readability, some clients could choose to make use of both formats in different places which is what the Babylon wallet does.

The following is the same manifest represented in both formats:

When converting the instructions of a `TransactionManifest` from one format to another, there are typically two main arguments required:

1. The format of the instructions to receive back, this is provided as an `InstructionList.Kind` which can either be `String` or `Parsed`.
2. The id of the network that the manifest is meant for. This is used in two main ways:
   - Validating that the addresses present in the manifest belong to the specified network.
   - Bech32m encoding the addresses during the conversion process.

### Example A

`TransactionManifest` objects have a `convert` method which converts the instructions in the transaction manifest from one instruction format to another.

```ts
import {
    TransactionManifest,
    InstructionList,
    NetworkId
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let transactionManifest: TransactionManifest = /* Some Transaction Manifest */;
let convertedManifest: TransactionManifest = await transactionManifest.convert(
    InstructionList.Kind.Parsed, /* The instruction format to convert to */
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The id of the network of the manifest */
);
```

### Example B

The `convertManifest` static function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` could also be used here to perform the same conversion

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  TransactionManifest,
  NetworkId
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let transactionManifest: TransactionManifest = /* Some Transaction Manifest */;
let convertedManifest = await RadixEngineToolkit.convertManifest(
  transactionManifest, /* The transaction manifest to convert */
  InstructionList.Kind.Parsed, /* The instruction format to convert to */
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The id of the network of the manifest */
);
```

## Transaction Compilation

The TypeScript Radix Engine Toolkit allows for transaction intents of various kinds to be compiled. The compilation of transaction intents is an essential part of transaction construction since what is signed is the hash of the compiled intents and not the human readable intents. The need to compile intents is abstracted away by the `TransactionBuilder` and the `ActionTransactionBuilder` classes (discussed elsewhere in this document) which allows clients to construct transactions without the need to understand or worry about the internals of how it is done.

There are three main transaction intent types and the Radix Engine Toolkit allows for the compilation (and decompilation as well) of all three of the transaction intent types, the intent types are:

1. **(Unsigned) Transaction Intent:** contains the `TransactionManifest` and the `TransactionHeader` of the transaction which describe all of the asset movements as well as the transaction bounds, constraints, and notary.
2. **Signed Transaction Intent:** consists of the (Unsigned) `TransactionIntent` and zero or more intent signatures (`SignatureWithPublicKey`).
3. **Notarized Transaction Intent:** consists of the `SignedTransactionIntent` and exactly one notary signature (`Signature`) where the public key of the notary must match that present in the transaction intent.

### Compiling `TransactionIntent`s

Given a `TransactionIntent` object, the `RadixEngineToolkit` class can be used to compile the it down to a byte array of SBOR bytes.

#### Example A

`TransactionIntent` objects have a `compile` method which performs the required invocations to the `RadixEngineToolkit` class to compile the object to a `Uint8Array` of the compiled intent.

```ts
import { TransactionIntent } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let transactionIntent: TransactionIntent = /* A transaction intent */;
let compiledTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = await transactionIntent.compile();
```

#### Example B

The `RadixEngineToolkit` class exposes functions for compiling `TransactionIntent` objects. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `compileTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import { TransactionIntent, RadixEngineToolkit } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let transactionIntent: TransactionIntent = /* A transaction intent */;
let compiledTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = await RadixEngineToolkit.compileTransactionIntent(
  transactionIntent
);
```

### Compiling `SignedTransactionIntent`s

Given a `SignedTransactionIntent` object, the `RadixEngineToolkit` class can be used to compile the it down to a byte array of SBOR bytes.

#### Example A

`SignedTransactionIntent` objects have a `compile` method which performs the required invocations to the `RadixEngineToolkit` class to compile the object to a `Uint8Array` of the compiled signed intent.

```ts
import { SignedTransactionIntent } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let signedTransactionIntent: SignedTransactionIntent = /* A transaction intent */;
let compiledSignedTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = await signedTransactionIntent.compile();
```

#### Example B

The `RadixEngineToolkit` class exposes functions for compiling `TransactionIntent` objects. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `compileSignedTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import { SignedTransactionIntent, RadixEngineToolkit } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let signedTransactionIntent: SignedTransactionIntent = /* A signed transaction intent */;
let compiledSignedTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = await RadixEngineToolkit.compileSignedTransactionIntent(
  signedTransactionIntent
);
```

### Compiling `NotarizedTransaction`s

Given a `NotarizedTransaction` object, the `RadixEngineToolkit` class can be used to compile the it down to a byte array of SBOR bytes.

#### Example A

`NotarizedTransaction` objects have a `compile` method which performs the required invocations to the `RadixEngineToolkit` class to compile the object to a `Uint8Array` of the compiled signed intent.

```ts
import { NotarizedTransaction } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let notarizedTransaction: NotarizedTransaction = /* A transaction intent */;
let compiledNotarizedTransaction: Uint8Array = await notarizedTransaction.compile();
```

#### Example B

The `RadixEngineToolkit` class exposes functions for compiling `TransactionIntent` objects. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `compileNotarizedTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import { NotarizedTransaction, RadixEngineToolkit } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let notarizedTransaction: NotarizedTransaction = /* A signed transaction intent */;
let compiledNotarizedTransaction: Uint8Array = await RadixEngineToolkit.compileNotarizedTransactionIntent(
  notarizedTransaction
);
```

## Transaction Decompilation

The TypeScript Radix Engine Toolkit is capable of decompiling transaction intents from their SBOR byte array format to a human-readable/machine-readable format that's easy to understand, read, and parse. This is useful when verifying transactions before signing them to ensure that they contain the intent that was communicated.

Similar to compilation, the Radix Engine Toolkit is able to decompile all three transaction intent types: (Unsigned) Transaction intents, signed transaction intents, and notarized transaction intents.

During decompilation, the client is free to choose the format of the output manifest instructions which can either be `String` or `Parsed`. The `String` format is the most common format and is the one seen in the `.rtm` files, in the radixdlt-scrypto repository, and almost everywhere. The `Parsed` format is a less common format but one which a number of programmatic clients heavily rely on which represents manifests as an AST of the various tokens in the tree.

### Decompiling Unknown Intents

There might be cases when the client is presented with an intent of an unknown kind and wishes to decompile said intent; as in, it is unknown whether this is an unsigned transaction intent, signed transaction intent, or a notarized transaction intent. While it's certainly possible for the client to try all of the different possibilities to figure it out, the core toolkit offers a function that determines the type of the intent and decompiles it accordingly.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  TransactionIntent,
  SignedTransactionIntent,
  NotarizedTransaction
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledUnknownIntent: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let decompiledUnknownIntent = await RadixEngineToolkit.decompileUnknownTransactionIntent(
  compiledUnknownIntent
);
if (decompiledUnknownIntent instanceof TransactionIntent) {
  console.log('Transaction Intent', decompiledUnknownIntent.toString());
} else if (decompiledUnknownIntent instanceof SignedTransactionIntent) {
  console.log('Signed Transaction Intent', decompiledUnknownIntent.toString());
} else if (decompiledUnknownIntent instanceof NotarizedTransaction) {
  console.log('Notarized Transaction Intent', decompiledUnknownIntent.toString());
}
```

### Decompiling a `TransactionIntent`

Given a byte array (`Uint8Array`) which is known to be a compiled `TransactionIntent`, the Radix Engine Toolkit can be used to decompile it to a `TransactionIntent` object. As previously stated, the client can specify whether they wish for the instructions in the decompiled intent to be `String` or `Parsed` instructions. If no format is specified, then it defaults to `String` instructions.

#### Example A

The `TransactionIntent` class has a static `decompile` function which can be thought of as a constructor for the class that's capable of creating objects of the class given a compiled transaction intent and an optional format of the instructions.

```ts
import {
  TransactionIntent,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let transactionIntent: TransactionIntent = await TransactionIntent.decompile(
  compiledTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Transaction Intent:', transactionIntent.toString())
```

#### Example B

An alternative to the above is calling the `decompileTransactionIntent` function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `decompileTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  TransactionIntent,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let transactionIntent: TransactionIntent = await RadixEngineToolkit.decompileTransactionIntent(
  compiledTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Transaction Intent:', transactionIntent.toString())
```

### Decompiling a `SignedTransactionIntent`

Given a byte array (`Uint8Array`) which is known to be a compiled `SignedTransactionIntent`, the Radix Engine Toolkit can be used to decompile it to a `SignedTransactionIntent` object. As previously stated, the client can specify whether they wish for the instructions in the decompiled intent to be `String` or `Parsed` instructions. If no format is specified, then it defaults to `String` instructions.

#### Example A

The `SignedTransactionIntent` class has a static `decompile` function which can be thought of as a constructor for the class that's capable of creating objects of the class given a compiled transaction intent and an optional format of the instructions.

```ts
import {
  SignedTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledSignedTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let signedTransactionIntent: SignedTransactionIntent = await SignedTransactionIntent.decompile(
  compiledSignedTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Signed Transaction Intent:', signedTransactionIntent.toString())
```

#### Example B

An alternative to the above is calling the `decompileSignedTransactionIntent` function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `decompileSignedTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  SignedTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledSignedTransactionIntent: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let signedTransactionIntent: SignedTransactionIntent = await RadixEngineToolkit.decompileSignedTransactionIntent(
  compiledSignedTransactionIntent,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Signed Transaction Intent:', signedTransactionIntent.toString())
```

### Decompiling a `NotarizedTransaction`

Given a byte array (`Uint8Array`) which is known to be a compiled `NotarizedTransaction`, the Radix Engine Toolkit can be used to decompile it to a `NotarizedTransaction` object. As previously stated, the client can specify whether they wish for the instructions in the decompiled intent to be `String` or `Parsed` instructions. If no format is specified, then it defaults to `String` instructions.

#### Example A

The `NotarizedTransaction` class has a static `decompile` function which can be thought of as a constructor for the class that's capable of creating objects of the class given a compiled transaction intent and an optional format of the instructions.

```ts
import {
  NotarizedTransaction,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledNotarizedTransaction: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let notarizedTransactionIntent: NotarizedTransaction = await NotarizedTransaction.decompile(
  compiledNotarizedTransaction,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Signed Transaction Intent:', notarizedTransactionIntent.toString())
```

#### Example B

An alternative to the above is calling the `decompileNotarizedTransactionIntent` function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class. In fact, under the hood of the syntax seen in the above example (Example A), this exact call to `decompileNotarizedTransactionIntent` is what takes place.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  NotarizedTransaction,
  InstructionList
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let compiledNotarizedTransaction: Uint8Array = /* Some compiled intent */;
let notarizedTransactionIntent: NotarizedTransaction = await RadixEngineToolkit.decompileNotarizedTransactionIntent(
  compiledNotarizedTransaction,
  InstructionList.Kind.String /* Optional argument, defaults to `String` if not provided */
);
console.log('Notarized Transaction Intent:', notarizedTransactionIntent.toString())
```

## Static Transaction Validation

The Radix Engine Toolkit offers the means for clients to perform static validation on their transactions to determine their (static) validity prior to submission to the network. To be more exact, the following are the checks performed by the Radix Engine Toolkit:

1. Validates that the compiled notarized intent passed is of a valid SBOR encoding.
2. Validates that the signature of the notary matches matches that expected given the public key provided in the header and a message of the signed transaction intent.
3. Validates all of the provided intent signatures are correct.
4. Performs ID Validation on the transaction manifest. This step ensures that none of the manifest buckets are used twice, used after dropped and other errors pertaining to manifest semantics.
5. Validates that the tip percentage specified in the transaction header is within the allowed limits.
6. Validates that the cost unit limit specified in the header is within the allowed limits.
7. Validates that the epoch window (the difference between the start and end epoch from the header) is within the allowed limits.
8. Validates that the id of the network specified in the header matches that which is expected.
9. Validates that the version id in the header is valid.

When performing static validation, configuration for the validator should be passed in as an argument to the validator.

### Example A

The `NotarizedTransaction` class has a method for running static analysis on the notarized transaction given some validation configuration.

```ts
import {
  NotarizedTransaction,
  ValidationConfig,
  NetworkId
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let notarizedTransaction: NotarizedTransaction = /* Some notarized transaction */;
let transactionValidity = await notarizedTransaction(ValidationConfig.default(NetworkId.Mainnet));
if (transactionValidity.isValid) {
  console.log("The transaction is valid")
} else {
  console.log("The transaction is invalid:", transactionValidity.errorMessage)
}
```

### Example B

The same operation can be performed through the `RadixEngineToolkit` class and the `staticallyValidateTransaction` static function.

```ts
import {
  NotarizedTransaction,
  ValidationConfig,
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  NetworkId
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let notarizedTransaction: NotarizedTransaction = /* Some notarized transaction */;
let transactionValidity = await RadixEngineToolkit.staticallyValidateTransaction(
  notarizedTransaction,
  ValidationConfig.default(NetworkId.Mainnet)
);
if (transactionValidity.isValid) {
  console.log("The transaction is valid")
} else {
  console.log("The transaction is invalid:", transactionValidity.errorMessage)
}
```

## SBOR Encoding and Decoding

The Radix Engine Toolkit comes with full support of the two flavours of SBOR that are currently in use in the Radix Engine: Scrypto SBOR and Manifest SBOR. The toolkit has two polymorphic value models uses to describe all of the possible types that the two SBOR flavours can have: `ScryptoSborValue.Value` and `ManifestSborValue.Value`. When performing SBOR Encoding or Decoding, the two above-mentioned classes are used.

### SBOR Encoding

To SBOR encode an instance of `ScryptoSborValue.Value` or `ManifestSborValue.Value`, the `sborEncode` method on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class can be used.

```ts
import {
  ScryptoSborValue,
  ManifestSborValue,
  RadixEngineToolkit
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let value = ScryptoSborValue.Value | ManifestSborValue.Value = /* Some SBOR Value */;
let encodedValue: Uint8Array = await RadixEngineToolkit.sborEncode(value);
```

### SBOR Decoding

Given an array of SBOR bytes, clients can decode these bytes and make sense of them by calling the `sborDecode` function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class. This will return an `SborValue.Value` object which can either be `ScryptoSborValue.Value` or `ManifestSborValue.Value`.

When performing SBOR decoding, one of the required arguments is a network id. This network id will be used to perform Bech32m encoding on the encountered addresses while decoding the value. Thus, this could be the id of the network that the value is thought to have originated from, the id of the network that the value is thought to be meant for, or any id if the value is known not to contain any addresses.

```ts
import {
  SborValue,
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  NetworkId
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let encodedValue: Uint8Array = /* Some SBOR Encoded Value */;
let value: SborValue.Value = await RadixEngineToolkit.sborDecode(
  encodedValue, /* The SBOR Encoded value */
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The network id */
);
console.log(value.toString());
```

## Address Derivations

The Radix Engine Toolkit exposes a number of address derivation functions that can be useful to a wide variety of clients. This section discussed these address derivation functions and provides examples as to how they can be done.

In general, all of the address derivations can be done in two main ways:

1. By calling the appropriate function on the `RadixEngineToolkit` class which performs the derivation and returns a string.
2. By calling the appropriate function on one of the address types to perform the derivation and create a new instance of that address type. This is the case for the following address types: `ManifestAstValue.Address`, `ManifestSborValue.Address`, `ScryptoSborValue.Address`, and `EntityAddress`.

### Deriving Virtual Account Addresses from Public Keys

The Radix Engine Toolkit allows for virtual account component addresses to be derived from Ecdsa Secp256k1 and EdDSA Ed25519 public keys. This derivation process follows a deterministic process where each public key maps to exactly one virtual account address.

#### Example A

The various address types implemented in the Radix Engine Toolkit have a `virtualAccountAddress` method which performs this derivation and creates a new object of that class.

```ts
import {
  ManifestAstValue,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let publicKey = new PublicKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "03ce65a44a837dd5cd0e274c3280ab3d602e7ce1e1e3eaff769f2d2fc54cac733e"
);
let virtualAccountAddress =
  await ManifestAstValue.Address.virtualAccountAddress(
    publicKey,
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
  );
console.log(virtualAccountAddress.toString());
```

#### Example B

Address derivations can be performed through the `RadixEngineToolkit` class which performs the derivation and returns the addresses as strings.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let publicKey = new PublicKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "03ce65a44a837dd5cd0e274c3280ab3d602e7ce1e1e3eaff769f2d2fc54cac733e"
);
let address: string = await RadixEngineToolkit.deriveVirtualAccountAddress(
  publicKey,
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
);
console.log(address);
```

### Deriving Virtual Identity Addresses from Public Keys

The Radix Engine Toolkit allows for virtual identity component addresses to be derived from Ecdsa Secp256k1 and EdDSA Ed25519 public keys. This derivation process follows a deterministic process where each public key maps to exactly one virtual identity address.

#### Example A

The various address types implemented in the Radix Engine Toolkit have a `virtualIdentityAddress` method which performs this derivation and creates a new object of that class.

```ts
import {
  ManifestAstValue,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let publicKey = new PublicKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "03ce65a44a837dd5cd0e274c3280ab3d602e7ce1e1e3eaff769f2d2fc54cac733e"
);
let virtualIdentityAddress =
  await ManifestAstValue.Address.virtualIdentityAddress(
    publicKey,
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
  );
console.log(virtualIdentityAddress.toString());
```

#### Example B

Address derivations can be performed through the `RadixEngineToolkit` class which performs the derivation and returns the addresses as strings.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let publicKey = new PublicKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "03ce65a44a837dd5cd0e274c3280ab3d602e7ce1e1e3eaff769f2d2fc54cac733e"
);
let address: string = await RadixEngineToolkit.deriveVirtualIdentityAddress(
  publicKey,
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
);
console.log(address);
```

### Deriving Babylon Account Addresses from Olympia Account Addresses

The Radix Engine Toolkit is able to perform the deterministic mapping to convert Olympia account addresses to their respective Babylon Account addresses.

#### Example A

The various address types implemented in the Radix Engine Toolkit have a `fromOlympiaAccountAddress` method which performs this derivation and creates a new object of that class.

```ts
import {
  ManifestAstValue,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let olympiaAccountAddress: string =
  "rdx1qspx7zxmnrh36q33av24srdfzg7m3cj65968erpjuh7ja3rm3kmn6hq4j9842";
let virtualIdentityAddress =
  await ManifestAstValue.Address.fromOlympiaAccountAddress(
    olympiaAccountAddress,
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
  );
console.log(virtualIdentityAddress.toString());
```

#### Example B

Address derivations can be performed through the `RadixEngineToolkit` class which performs the derivation and returns the addresses as strings.

```ts
import {
  RadixEngineToolkit,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let olympiaAccountAddress: string =
  "rdx1qspx7zxmnrh36q33av24srdfzg7m3cj65968erpjuh7ja3rm3kmn6hq4j9842";
let { babylonAccountAddress, publicKey } =
  await RadixEngineToolkit.deriveBabylonAddressFromOlympiaAddress(
    olympiaAccountAddress,
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
  );
console.log(virtualIdentityAddress);
```

### Derive Known Entity Addresses

There are various entities created at the Babylon genesis which have a known set of addresses. The following entities (and their addresses) are all created at genesis:

- Resources
  - XRD Resource
  - Ecdsa Secp256k1 Resource
  - EdDSA Ed25519 Resource
  - System Resource
  - Package Badge Resource
- Components
  - Faucet Component (if exists)
  - Epoch Manager Component
  - Clock Component
- Packages
  - Faucet Package (if exists)
  - Account Package

The Radix Engine Toolkit can be used to provide the above mentioned addresses on any network that the client chooses.

#### Example A

The various address types exposed by the Radix Engine Toolkit expose methods to derive these well known addresses on any network. For the purposes of this example, we will be deriving the resource address of the XRD resource on mainnet.

```ts
import { ManifestAstValue, NetworkId } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let xrdResourceAddress = await ManifestAstValue.Address.xrdResourceAddress(
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
);
console.log(xrdResourceAddress.toString());
```

#### Example B

The `RadixEngineToolkit` class exposes a method to get all of the well known addresses for a given network.

```ts
import { RadixEngineToolkit, NetworkId } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let knownAddresses = await RadixEngineToolkit.knownEntityAddresses(
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the addresses for. */
);
console.log(knownAddresses);
```

# Longterm Support (LTS) Radix Engine Toolkit

So far, this document has only talked about the `RadixEngineToolkit` class. However, another class for interacting with the core Radix Engine Toolkit does exist and was discussed in the architecture section: the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit`. This class is meant to provide a smaller interface with a higher degree of backward compatability that is suitable for third parties hoping to integrate with the Radix Babylon ledger. 

As previously discussed, the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` and other classes that fall under the LTS umbrella are not mean to provide the complete functionality of the core Radix Engine Toolkit to clients, quite the opposite, they are meant to provide simple interfaces to functionality that integratros need. There is a chance that a client might outgrow the LTS garden and need utilize some of the classes and concepts outside of the LTS. 

The following set of classes currently fall under the are currently considered to be in LTS:
- `ActionTransactionBuilder`
- `LTSRadixEngineToolkit`
  - `Transaction` API Group
  - `Derive` API Group
  - `Utils` API Group

## Constructing Trasnactions through Higher Level Actions

One of the classes that are considered in LTS is the `ActionTransactionBuilder` which is a class that allows for the construction of transactions through higher-level actions to specify intent. Constructing transactions in such a manner means that a client does not need to interact with or build their own transaction manifest. The `ActionTransactionBuilder` class will handle the complete process of construcint the transaction from beginning to end, including the transaction manifest. Additionally, clients that use the `ActionTransactionBuilder` would not need to understand the construction process, when (or on what) hashing is done, or other information.

Despite the simple interface of the `ActionTransactionBuilder`, it is a powerful way for constructing transactions. The following is a list of features supported by the `ActionTransactionBuilder`:

- Allows for many to many transfer of fungible tokens.
- Aggregates withdraws and deposits into and from accounts to optimize for fees.
- Can be used with a single signer or with multiple signers.
- Sets many of the values in the header to overridable defaults.

At the current moment of time, the `ActionTransactionBuilder` supports a single action: the transfer of fungible tokens. Additional actions can be added to this class in the future to allow it to be more useful for other use cases. 

The following is an example on how this class can be used to build a transaction that transfers funds from accounts A and B into account C.

```ts
import {
  NetworkId,
  PrivateKey,
  NotarizedTransaction,
  ActionTransactionBuilder
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let notaryPrivateKey = new PrivateKey.EddsaEd25519(
  "d52618de62aa37a9fdac229614ca931d9e509e00cd01ff9f465e5dba5e17be8b"
);
let signerPrivateKey = new PrivateKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "5068952ca5aa655fe9257bf2d89f3b86f4dda6be6f5b76e4ed104c38fd21e8d7"
);

let account1 =
  "account_sim1qjdkmaevmu7ggs3jyruuykx2u5c2z7mp6wjk5f5tpy6swx5788";
let account2 =
  "account_sim1qj0vpwp3l3y8jhk6nqtdplx4wh6mpu8mhu6mep4pua3q8tn9us";
let account3 =
  "account_sim1qjj40p52dnww68e594c3jq6h3s8xr75fgcnpvlwmypjqmqamld";

let resourceAddress1 =
  "resource_sim1qyw4pk2ecwecslf55dznrv49xxndzffnmpcwjavn5y7qyr2l73";

let transaction: NotarizedTransaction = await ActionTransactionBuilder.new(
  10 /* The start epoch (inclusive) of when this transaction becomes valid */,
  20 /* The end epoch (exclusive) of when this transaction is no longer valid */,
  NetworkId.Simulator /* The id of the network that this transactions is destined for */,
  account1 /* The fee payer */,
  notaryPrivateKey.publicKey() /* The notary's public key */
).then((builder) => {
  return builder
    .fungibleResourceTransfer(account1, account2, resourceAddress1, 100)
    .fungibleResourceTransfer(account3, account2, resourceAddress1, 100)
    .sign(signerPrivateKey)
    .notarize(notaryPrivateKey);
});

let transactionId: Uint8Array = await transaction.transactionId();
```

## `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` Functionality

This section discusses the functionality provided by the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` class and provides a number of examples.

### Derive API Group

This is a group of functions exposed by the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` that are used to perform various kinds of derivations. Typically, these are address derivations.

#### Deriving The (Virtual) Account Address from a Public Key

The `Derive` API group of the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` class exposes methods for deriving the (virtual) account component address associated with a public key.

```ts
import {
  LTSRadixEngineToolkit,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let publicKey = new PublicKey.EcdsaSecp256k1(
  "03ce65a44a837dd5cd0e274c3280ab3d602e7ce1e1e3eaff769f2d2fc54cac733e"
);
let address: string = await LTSRadixEngineToolkit.Derive.virtualAccountAddress(
  publicKey,
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
);
console.log(address);
```

#### Deriving The Babylon (Virtual) Account Address from an Olympia Account Address

The `Derive` API group of the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` class exposes methods for deriving the Babylon (virtual) account component address associated with an Olympia account address.

```ts
import {
  LTSRadixEngineToolkit,
  PublicKey,
  NetworkId,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let olympiaAccountAddress: string =
  "rdx1qspx7zxmnrh36q33av24srdfzg7m3cj65968erpjuh7ja3rm3kmn6hq4j9842";
let { babylonAccountAddress, publicKey } =
  await LTSRadixEngineToolkit.Derive.babylonAccountAddressFromOlympiaAccountAddress(
    olympiaAccountAddress,
    NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the address for. */
  );
console.log(virtualIdentityAddress);
```

#### Deriving Known Addresses

There are various entities created at the Babylon genesis which have a known set of addresses. The following entities (and their addresses) are all created at genesis:

- Resources
  - XRD Resource
  - Ecdsa Secp256k1 Resource
  - EdDSA Ed25519 Resource
  - System Resource
  - Package Badge Resource
- Components
  - Faucet Component (if exists)
  - Epoch Manager Component
  - Clock Component
- Packages
  - Faucet Package (if exists)
  - Account Package

The Radix Engine Toolkit can be used to provide the above mentioned addresses on any network that the client chooses.

```ts
import { LTSRadixEngineToolkit, NetworkId } from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let knownAddresses = await LTSRadixEngineToolkit.Derive.knownAddresses(
  NetworkId.Mainnet /* The ID of the network to derive the addresses for. */
);
console.log(knownAddresses);
```

### Utils API Group

#### Hashing

The `Utils` API group of the `LTSRadixEngineToolkit` offers a methdo for hashing data through the hashing algorithm used in Scrypto and the Radix Engine which is Blake2b with 32 byte long digests

```ts
import {
  LTSRadixEngineToolkit,
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let data: Uint8Array = /* Some array of bytes */;
let hashedData: Uint8Array = LTSRadixEngineToolkit.Utils.hash(data);
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
    <summary>How to obtain the transaction id (transaction hash) of a transaction?</summary>
    
Objects of the `TransactionIntent`, `SignedTransactionIntent`, and `NotarizedTransaction` classes offer methods for calculating the transaction id (transaction hash). Given that you have any of the above mentioned objects, the transaction id can be obtained as follows:

```ts
import {
    TransactionIntent,
    SignedTransactionIntent,
    NotarizedTransaction
} from "@radixdlt/radix-engine-toolkit";

let intent: TransactionIntent | SignedTransactionIntent | NotarizedTransaction = /* Some kind of intent */;
let transactionId: Uint8Array = await intent.transactionId();
```

In addition to the `transactionId` method, some of these classes also offer methods for calculating the notarized transaction hash (often times referred to as payload hash in the Gateway API) and the signed transaction intent hash. However, these hashes are rarely needed in day-to-day interactions with the network.
